# maze-js

Generates a random maze using recursive backtracking and traverses it using breadth-first search.

The recursive-backtracking algorithm for maze generation was derived from the work of [Jamis Buck](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/27/maze-generation-recursive-backtracking), who implemented the algorithm in Ruby.
